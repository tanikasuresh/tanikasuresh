# Hi, my name is Tanika Suresh!
I am currently a junior at the Rutgers Business School in New Brunswick! I am majoring in Business Analytics and Information Technology and hope to gain experience with data analysis through an internship.

During the past few semesters, I learned the basics of Excel functions, PivotTables, PivotCharts, SQL, Tableau, and Python. I have completed various projects (both in-class and personal) showcasing my capabilities displayed on my Github page.

I believe my work strongly exhibits my dedication to learning data analysis and my ability to absorb new material as I learn!
