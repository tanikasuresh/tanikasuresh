# Hi, my name is Tanika Suresh!
I am currently a sophomore at the Rutgers Business School in New Brunswick! I am majoring in Business Analytics and Information Technology and hope to gain experience with data analysis through an internship.

As my freshman year concluded, I took it upon myself to learn SQL. I practiced with various online resources to showcase my development and knowledge, and I am proud to display that work.

During the fall semester of 2023, I was enrolled in Management Informations Systems where I learned the basics of Excel functions, PivotTables, PivotCharts, and Tableau. The course projects are also displayed on my Github page.

I believe my work strongly exhibits my dedication to learning data analysis and my ability to absorb new material as I learn!
