# Hi, my name is Tanika Suresh!
I am currently a sophomore at the Rutgers Business School in New Brunswick! I am majoring in Business Analytics and Information Technology and hope to gain data analysis experience through an internship.

As my freshman year finished, I took it upon myself to learn some important tools and languages that analysts should know, like SQL and pandas. 
As I learned the basics, I practiced with various online resources to showcase my development and knowledge, and am proud to display that work.

While I am still a beginner, I believe my work over the 2023 summer strongly exhibits my dedication to learning data analysis and my ability to absorb new material as I learn!
